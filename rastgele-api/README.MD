You also need to eat regularly.\n\nMinecraft has gone through many development stages:\n\nClassic - the oldest version. It is still playable and has multiplayer. In Classic, you have an infinite amount of blocks, no health, and no [mobs].\n\nSurvival Test - Part of Classic, very basic compared to the Survival we play and know today.\n\n[Indev] - Added a number of new features, including [crafting], torches, and tools.\n\nInfdev - Added the ability to have an infinite playing surface.\n\nAlpha - Added [biomes], [nether], sneaking, and much more.\n\nBeta - The current version of Minecraft. Added beds (which can skip the night), more mobs such as [endermen] and wolves (which can be tamed with bones and attack monsters), and many more.\n\nMultiplayer is in both Classic and Beta, which allows, well, multiplayer, duhhhh",
